This simple Python program checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not.

## What is a Palindrome?
A palindrome number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.

# Examples:

121 → Palindrome 

123 → Not a palindrome 

-121 → Not a palindrome (negative sign breaks the symmetry)

## How It Works
Reject negative numbers right away. A negative number like -121 can never be a palindrome.

Keep a copy of the original number.

Reverse the number by:

Getting the last digit using % 10

Building the reversed number step-by-step

Removing the last digit using // 10

Compare the reversed number with the original.

If they are equal → it's a palindrome 

Otherwise → not a palindrome
